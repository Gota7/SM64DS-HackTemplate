## Why Use This?
So you may be wondering why you should use this template over just editing the ROM directly with SM64DSe. There may be a little extra work in setting up and learning the template, but it saves a lot of time in the long run. Improvements include:

* No more ROM corruption - The template will rebuild the ROM from its files, meaning that corruption is not possible.
* Files are extracted and uncompressed (even in archives) - Want to copy over some files or replace them? No problem, just use your OS's regular file manager!
* Elaborate patch folder design - Since the template separates files you edit from files from the base game, this allows you to keep track of *your* progress without having to worry about uploading any copyrighted material.
* Version control - Due to the template being setup as a git repository, you can easily keep track of changes you make to the game and even roll them back!
* SM64DSe integration - Edit your levels like you always have, and build and play your ROM directly with it too!
* MOM integration - You can use custom objects in the game as the template has MOM preinstalled!
* Complete build system - Simply double click the builder to get a menu of what to build. This allows you to build ASM hacks, custom overlays, and even DLs to be automatically injected into the game with only a few keystrokes!
* Hack exporting - Want to have someone else play your hack? The build system has an option to easily give them everything they need to play your romhack!
